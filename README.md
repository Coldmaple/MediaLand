# MediaLand
## Problem
Fake news, malicious opinions, capital driven media are flooding our daily lives. They occupy attention, grasp our time and consume social resources. Though social media to some extent enables ordinary people to voice out their own minds, the largest right to speak is still controled by a small group of famous people like celebrities, whom has achievement in certain areas. These people may specialize in one or two specific domains, but as for public opinions, their right to speak in front of other people is truly questionable. When famous people voice their biased minds, irrational attitudes or even corrupt opinions towards a social issue, ordinary people is very likely to be misled and have no access to combat with famous people. And that is because common individual lacks right of speak and power of attention in social discussions. In this sense, the concensus of social events can hardly be achieved by the majority of people in a society.
